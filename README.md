# AR Smart Kictchen


Here is the repo that contains our code for the AR SmartKictchen system

Repo and link to mobile app repo will be soon!

We propose a novel multi-modal AR system that combines both mobile and pro-cam display technologies. By combining mobile and pro-cam systems will not only remove each display’s limitations, but complement each other’s usability strengths to provide longer, higher-fidelity AR usage. We apply this contribution in the form of a smart kitchen application, that allows users to be provided instant cooking recommendations and intuitive instructions to prepare dishes. We evaluate our system on several participants, and discuss the potential this system brings for widespread adoption of AR.

To view code of interface go to the apps/blocks/ directory to view implementation of paper tracking and interface.

This is an extension of the papart-examples library.

# Papart library examples

Here are the Papart examples, to show atomic features.
Papart stands for PAPer Augmented Reality Toolkit. The core library is 
available on this [repository](https://github.com/poqudrof/papart).

## PapARt 1.0 is out. 

The first big release is out. We look forward for feedback and issue reports. We will enhance the guides and create tutorials, and for this any help will be appreciated ! 

**2017 update: PapARt is now working on Windows, OSX, Linux and Raspberry Pi.**

## Quick start guide

PapARt is a [Processing](http://processing.org) library, and it requires many other libraries to work. The smaller ones are included, and the heavy ones are separated.
Current version of Processing: 3.2.3 . Any higher version of Processing 3 should work. Processing 2, and 1 are not supported anymore.  

### Step 1 
* Download and install Processing  3.2.3.
* Run it once so that it creates a sketchbook folder (Processing folder for OSX and Windows).

### Step 2 
 
* Get the [PapARt library](http://jiii.fr/papart/libraries/PapARt-default.tgz), or check out our [version list](https://github.com/poqudrof/Papart-examples/wiki/PapARt-versions).
* Get the [other libs](http://jiii.fr/papart/libraries/libraries.zip): a collection of libraries for math, network, 3D, and GUI. It includes well known Processing libraries: PeasyCam, OSCP5, Video, Toxiclibs. And custom ones: SVGExtended, ProcessingTUIO, Skatolo, GuiModes, and Reflections. 
* Get JavaCV for your platform [Windows](http://jiii.fr/papart/libraries/javacv-windows-x86_64.tgz), [Linux x86_64](http://jiii.fr/papart/libraries/javacv-linux-x86_64.tgz), [Mac OSX](http://jiii.fr/papart/libraries/javacv-macosx-x86_64.tgz). Experimental: [armhf / Raspberry pi](http://jiii.fr/papart/libraries/javacv-linux-armhf.tgz), [android](http://jiii.fr/papart/libraries/javacv-android-arm.tgz)

### Step 3 

Unpack and install **all** the libraries to your sketchbook/library directory. If you are not sure how to install a library follow the  [official processing guide](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/How-to-Install-a-Contributed-Library). 

### Step 4

It's ready to work ! You can try it with a [webcam](https://github.com/poqudrof/Papart-examples/wiki/quick%20start%20webcam) for your first use.
